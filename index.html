        <div class="Exoplanets-text"><!--This is the first part of the homepage, like the first paragraph-->
            <p>Have you ever wondered if there are other stars or planets beyond our Solar System? The answer is yes—there are many other stars, planets, galaxies, and space objects out there in the universe.
               So, what exactly is the Solar System?</p>
            <p>It’s made up of a star (in our case, the Sun) and all the objects that move around it. These include planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. When we talk about our Solar System, we’re usually referring to the Sun, the eight planets from Mercury to Neptune, and their moons.
               But the Solar System isn’t the only one of its kind. There are also other planetary systems.</p>
            <p>So, what are planetary systems? They’re groups of space objects—like planets and moons—that orbit around a star, all held together by the star’s gravity.</p>

    <section class="Exoplanets-second-section">
        <div class="Exoplanets-second-text"><!--This is where my second paragraph starts-->
            <p>So, where are all these space objects hanging out? They’re in something called a galaxy.
               But what is a galaxy, really? It’s like a massive neighborhood in space, filled with stars, dust, dark matter, and all sorts of things—held together by gravity. And right in the center of most galaxies, there’s something really powerful: a black hole.</p>
            <p>Galaxies come in different shapes too. The three main types are spiral, elliptical, and irregular.</p>
            <p>Now, about those black holes I mentioned—what are they? Well, they’re areas in space where gravity is unbelievably strong. I mean really strong. So strong that nothing—not even light—can escape from them. Pretty mind-blowing, right?</p>

            <p>Asteroids — what are they?</p>
            <p>Asteroids are space rocks larger than meteorites but smaller than planets or comets. Think of them as leftover building blocks from the early Solar System, about 4.6 billion years ago. They're typically made of rock, metal, or sometimes ice, and unlike comets, they don't have an atmosphere or a tail.</p>
            <p>The majority of asteroids reside in the Asteroid Belt, a vast region located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Jupiter's strong gravity likely prevented the material in this area from forming a single large planet, scattering it into the many asteroids we see today.</p>
            <p>Beyond the main belt, some asteroids have orbits that bring them closer to Earth, known as Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs). Studying all these types of asteroids helps scientists understand more about how our Solar System formed and evolved.</p>

    <section class="quasar-section"><!--This is the section that is coming under the bottom of the comet section-->
        <div class="quasar-text"><!--I am going to add the text then the image-->
            <p>A quasar is an extremely bright object at the center of a galaxy, powered by a supermassive black hole. As gas and dust fall into the black hole, they heat up and release intense light, making quasars visible across billions of light-years. Most quasars are from the early universe and help scientists understand how galaxies and black holes formed. Their light comes from the hot material around the black hole, not the black hole itself.</p>

            <p>TOI-715b is a fascinating Super-Earth exoplanet that has been recently discovered by NASA’s TESS mission in 2023. 
            It is only over one and a half times the size of the Earth and is maybe roughly three times heavier. This exoplanet orbits a small, cool red dwarf star ( M-type star) and it takes about 19 days to orbit around once which is far shorter than our planet’s year. 
            This Exoplanet is located within the habitable zone of its star where the conditions might be able to support liquid water on the surface.
            The temperature is chilly, around -39°C but scientists find it potentially life-supporting.  As the first planet TESS discovered in this part of the habitable zone for life, TOI-715 b presents a candidate of interest for further study.</p>

            <p>Gliese 581c is an exoplanet that is orbiting within the Gliese 581 system. It is the second planet that is discovered in the system and third in order from the star.
               The planet has a mass of 6.8 times that of the Earth and is classified as a Super-Earth. This planet was discovered in 2007 and gained interest because it was in the habitable zone of the planet but based on the newer models,
               the planet is likely too hot to be potentially habitable. The Gliese 581 system is relatively close to Earth at 20.55 light years in the direction of the constellation of Libra.
               This distance, along with the declination and right ascension coordinates, give its exact location in the Milky Way. </p>

            <p>Proxima Centauri b is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri in the constellation Centaurus. The host star is the closest star to the Sun, at a distance of about 4.2 light years from Earth. 
               Proxima Centauri b orbits the parent star at a distance of about 0.04856 AU with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. The planet orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star, but it is not known whether it has an atmosphere, which would impact the probabilities of habitability.
               The Exoplanet’s star is a flare star with intense emission of electromagnetic radiation that could strip the atmosphere off the planet.</p>

            <p>Kepler-22b is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the Sun-like star Kepler-22. It is located about 640 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope in December 2011.Kepler-22b's radius is roughly twice that of Earth. Its mass and surface composition are unknown. 
               Evidence suggests that the planet has a moderate surface temperature, assuming that the surface is not subject to extreme greenhouse heating. 
               The planet's first transit was observed on 12 May 2009. Confirmation of the existence of Kepler-22b was announced on December 5, 2011.</p>

            <p>K2-18b is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf K2-18 and is located 124 light-years away from Earth. The planet is about 2.6 times the radius of Earth, with a 33-day orbit within the star's habitable zone, receiving approximately a similar amount of light as the Earth receives from the Sun. 
               In 2019, the presence of water vapour in K2-18b's atmosphere was reported, drawing scientific attention to this system. In 2023, the James Webb Space Telescope detected carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere of K2-18b. The planet more closely resembles an ice giant like Uranus or Neptune than Earth.
               In 2025, the atmosphere of K2-18b was reported to contain dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a chemical that could serve as a biosignature on exoplanets, in quantities 20 times higher than on Earth. </p>

            <p>TOI-715b is a fascinating Super-Earth exoplanet that has been recently discovered by NASA’s TESS mission in 2023. 
            It is only over one and a half times the size of the Earth and is maybe roughly three times heavier. This exoplanet orbits a small, cool red dwarf star ( M-type star) and it takes about 19 days to orbit around once which is far shorter than our planet’s year. This Exoplanet is located within the habitable zone of its star where the conditions might be able to support liquid water on the surface.
            The temperature is chilly, around -39°C but scientists find it potentially life-supporting.  As the first planet TESS discovered in this part of the habitable zone for life, TOI-715 b presents a candidate of interest for further study.</p>

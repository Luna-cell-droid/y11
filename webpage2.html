            <p>KELT-9b is the known hottest planet in the universe with a surface temperature of approximately 4,300 degrees Celsius (7,800 degrees Fahrenheit) and is located 670 light years away from Earth. This planet is similar to Jupiter as it is a gas giant with a similar size but more hotter
               due to its close proximity to its star. KELT-9b is a relatively large giant planet at about 2.8 times the mass of Jupiter;
               however given that its radius is nearly twice that of Jupiter, its density is less than half that of it.The star of this planet is twice as hot as our Sun (Sol) 
               and this planet always faces its star, resulting in extreme temperature differences between the two sides. Detected using the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope, the discovery of KELT-9b was announced in 2016.</p>

            <p>WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter planet which is orbiting the star WASP-12. This was discovered by the SuperWASP planetary transit survey in April of 2008. The planet only takes a little over one Earth day to complete its orbit and according to researchers working on the HST announced in September 2017 that WASP-12b reflects just
               6% of the light that shines on its surface but as a result, the exoplanet has been described ‘pitch black’ although 
               visually it would actually appear intensely bright due to the closeness to its star. The distance is approximately 3.5 million kilometers (149.6 million kilometers - between Earth and Sun).
               In December 3,2013 scientists reported detecting water in the atmosphere and in July 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on the planet.</p>

            <p>55 Cancri e formally known as Jassan is an exoplanet that is orbiting a Sun-like star named 55 Cancri A. The exoplanet was discovered on 30 August 2004 thus making it the first super-Earth discovered around a main sequence star. The mass of the exoplanet is about eight Earth masses and its diameter is about twice that of the Earth. 
               The atmosphere of 55 Cancri e has been extensively studied, with varying results. Initial studies suggested an atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium,
               but later studies failed to confirm this, instead supporting an atmosphere composed of heavier molecules, possibly only a thin atmosphere of vaporized rock.</p>

            <p>MASCARA-1b is a confirmed superjovian exoplanet, orbiting the A-type star MASCARA-1 (HD 201585). Now what is superjovian? Superjovian is A super-Jupiter is a gas giant exoplanet that is more massive than the planet Jupiter. 
               MASCARA-1b is a hot Jupiter transiting its parent A-type star; its orbit is misaligned with the star's rotation. The planet was found unusually 
               reflective for hot Jupiter. This planet was discovered on July 17, 2017. The temperature of this planet is 3062 K. </p>

            <p>HD 189733 b is an exoplanet in the constellation of Vulpecula approximately 64.5 light-years from the Solar System.  Astronomers in France discovered the planet orbiting the star HD 189733 on October 5, 2005, by observing its transit across the star's face. The planet has 11.2% higher mass and 11.4% greater radius than Jupiter.
               HD 189733 b orbits its host star once every 2.2 days at an orbital speed of 152.0 kilometers per second. The planet’s cobalt blue color comes from a hazy,
               blow-torched atmosphere containing clouds laced with glass.Researchers have found that the planet’s weather makes it rain molten glass. In July 2014, NASA discovered that it has a very dry atmosphere.</p>

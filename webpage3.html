            <p>WD 1856+534 b is a planet that orbits white dwarf located in the constellation of Draco with a distance of 80 light years from the Earth and is the outer component of a visual triple star system with an inner pair of red dwarf stars named G 229-20.
               The planet has an effective temperature of 4700 K with an approximate age of 5.8 million years.  Its mass is 13.8 Jupiters, it takes 1.4 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.0204 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in 2020. 
               Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have detected the planet that was orbiting a dead star. </p>

             <p>PSR B1620-26 b is an exoplanet located in the constellation of Scorpius which is 12,400 light years away from the Earth.  It have different nicknames such as Methuselah which is named after the Biblical character, who, according to the Bible, lived to be the oldest person and "the Genesis planet" due to its extreme age. This planet has a circumbinary orbit around the two 
               stars of PSR B1620-26 which are a pulsar and a white dwarf. And this is the first circumbinary planet ever confirmed.
               The planet is one of the oldest known extrasolar planets which is believed to be formed 12.7 billion years ago.</p>

            <p>OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is a planet which is also a Super-Earth but is so cold that it is known as the Super-Earth ice Exoplanet. This exoplanet is orbiting a star called OGLE-2005-BLG-390L and this star is approximately 21,500 - 3,300 light years away from Earth and is located near the center of the Milky Way. This location makes the planet to be known as one of the distant planets to ever be discovered.
               The planet does not appear to meet the conditions which are necessary to support life. This planet have five times more mass
               than the Earth and has a rocky core. Its temperature is −220 °C; −370 °F and it is one of the coldest recorded. </p>

            <p>Epsilon Eridani b is a Jupiter-like exoplanet that is located in the constellation Eridanus with just 10.5 light years away from the Earth. This planet was discovered in 2000 with Doppler spectroscopy. What is Doppler spectroscopy? It is an indirect method to find extrasolar planets using radial-velocity measurements. This exoplanet is the only planet that is confirmed to orbit around the star Epsilon Eridani. Its formal name was Ægir and it has a mass
               close to Jupiter and a nearly circular orbit of 3.53 AU completed every 7.32 years, Ægir is considered a close analog to our solar system’s gas giant. The name was gathered from the Norse Mythology. 
               Despite early doubts about its existence, subsequent observations—including by the James Webb Space Telescope—have confirmed its presence and refined its orbital details</p>

            <p>TRAPPIST-1g is an exoplanet orbiting around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, located 40.7 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. It was one of four new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting the star in 2017 using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The exoplanet is within the optimistic habitable zone of its host star.
               It was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. 
               The second-most-distant-known planet in its system, TRAPPIST-1g is a planet somewhat larger than Earth and with a similar density, meaning it is likely a rocky planet.</p>
